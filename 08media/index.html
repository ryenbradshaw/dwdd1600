        <p>Hello! My name is Ryen Bradshaw and I am currently a Junior at Utah Valley University. In my free time I love to coach volleyball, be outside, and binge reality T.V. shows. I also love taking up new hobbies to help me continue learning new art skills. My current obsession is print making and it's the funnest thing. I recommend looking into new hobbies to <strong>continue developing your artsy side</strong>!</p>
        
        
        <p>As for my art career, I always loved art when growing up, but was unsure if I wanted to pursue it as a career. After taking some classes in college, I realized that I did want to do something artsy because <em>I love being hands on</em>. After a few semsesters of many art classes, I started seriously thinking which direction I would want to go. <a href="myinspiration.html#inspiration">I was constantly pondering and researching</a> and landed on Graphic Design and digital work. I loved creating logos and layouts for brands, as well as website design. I really enjoy the more graphic and simplicitic style and have loved perfecting my craft. I can't wait to continue learning about what I love, and start working in graphic arts!</p>
        
        <h2>My Favorite Programs</h2>

            <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
